# Hi! I'm a Full Stack Developer
### with love and passion for prograaming and building web applications. I specialize in building scalable and performant web applications using modern technologies.

A programmer who takes pleasure in exploring the culinary world of spices when Iâ€™m not coding. An avid anime enthusiast, often getting lost in the vibrant worlds of imagination and compelling stories. A budding chess grand master to be (because always dream big right :p), amused by the strategic depth of chess, looking for the next challenge to outmanoeuvre. From trends in technology to flavours of food, I take pleasure in diverse interests beyond my nine to five.

Innovator by nature, I enjoy staying up to date with tech and keep learning new things in software development space. I have over three years of experience in designing and implementing robust code for high-volume businesses. I thrive on full-stack development and platform architecture, and I use my interpersonal skills to work with engineering teams to find efficient business solutions. My passion for programming often inspires me to tackle complex problems. I experiment with modern web technologies to enhance the end user experience. I have a strong background in developing and optimizing data processes that deliver consistent high-quality, scalable applications.
