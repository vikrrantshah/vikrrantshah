Hi! I'm a Full Stack Developer with a passion for building web applications. I specialize in building scalable and performant web applications using modern technologies.

A programmer who takes pleasure in exploring the culinary world of spices when Iâ€™m not coding. An avid anime enthusiast, often getting lost in the vibrant worlds of imagination and compelling stories. A budding chess grand master to be (because always dream big right :p), amused by the strategic depth of chess, looking for the next challenge to outmanoeuvre. From trends in technology to flavours of food, I take pleasure in diverse interests beyond my nine to five.
